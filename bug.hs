This Haskell code attempts to use the `ByteString` library to read a file, but it does not handle potential exceptions, such as the file not being found.  This can lead to runtime errors. 
```haskell
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B

main :: IO ()
main = do
  contents <- B.readFile "my_file.txt"
  putStrLn $ "File contents:" ++ show contents
```
